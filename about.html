    My name is Lindsay S. Shaffer and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University's Department of Psychology with a concentration in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. My advisor is Dr. Craig McDonald. I am also a NSF NRT Fellow through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions (CASBBI).
    <p>My research focuses on what information we use to make decisions and how that information is reflected as brain activity. Specifically, I am investigating the extent to which information about hedonic value and motivational states contributes to the processes generating the Reward Positivity (RewP), a frontocentral event-related potential occurring 200-350 ms following reward receipt. Prior work has suggested the RewP sensitive to subjective reward preferences and modulated by internal state, but no study has examined both in the same study. Understanding whether changes in current reward value modulate the RewP have broader implications for deficits in decision-making found in several diseases such as major depression and Parkinson's disease. I answer these questions using computational modeling, behavioral paradigms, and brain recording techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG).
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, fiber art (knitting, crochet), fashion, thrifting, videogames, and hiking. I used to compete in sabre fencing during my undergrad and post-bacc. I was also a choir member for CBS' Kennedy Center Honors and TNT's Christmas in Washington for six years.
